- Are you new to an academic field? Read a review paper! It often provides an introduction, summarizes the current knowledge in the field, and sometimes provides a brief history and future perspectives. Here is an example, open access <a href='https://www.mdpi.com/2079-7737/12/2/152'>review paper</a>.
- Make sure to add comments to your code explaining what it does. Not only will it help others understand your code when you share it, but also yourself when you revisit code you haven't look at in a while!
- "Use a citation manager to keep track, organize and cite your references. I use <a href='https://www.zotero.org/'>Zotero</a>, which is free and open source."

- "Sequencing tip: Before starting each sequencing run, check to make sure there is enough disk space available to store the data! Depending on the sequencing platform and run type, you may need to check even before you build the library."
- "Keep track of all your terminal shortcuts by creating a shortcut to show all of them (<a href='https://jazsakr.github.io/macos/shortcut-for-terminal-shortcuts/'>read more</a>)."
- Keep as many variables as possible at the top of your code so that not only are they easy to find, but you only have to edit them once and it is consistent throughout your code.
- Keep track of package versions used in your analysis by saving them into a log file when you run your scripts. 
- If you are connecting to a remote server and will run a  command that will take a long time to finish, start a `screen` or `tmux` session first so that if your connection drops, the command will keep running and you can reconnect to it later.
- "Making stock solutions from salts/powder? Use <a href='https://www.promega.com/resources/tools/biomath/molarity-calculator/'>this calculator</a> to figure out how many grams you need."
- Make stock solutions for new protocols before the day of the experiment. Some stock solutions may take time to fully dissolve and may even need to be warmed up or mixed overnight.
- "macOS tip: Reading a paper online and you can't remember if you saved it to Zotero or not? Use the <a href='https://www.alfredapp.com/'>Alfred</a> workflow <a href='https://alfred.app/workflows/giovanni/zothero/'>ZotHero</a> to quickly check."
