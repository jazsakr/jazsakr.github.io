Sometimes we can only download a citation from [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/about/) but it cannot be readily imported into some of the common citation mangers because it is a [`.nbib`](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/help/#cite) file, a format created by the National Library of Medicine. Common citation managers import [RIS (Research Information Systems)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RIS_(file_format)) files. Therefore we need to convert `.nbib` to `.ris`. 

One tool we can use is online converters like [this one](https://paperpile.com/t/pmid-to-ris-converter/) from [Paperpile](https://paperpile.com/?welcome) (**<font color="red">NOT a paid promotion</font>**):

## Download the `.nbib` citation

First, we need to download a citation off the PubMed website. Here is [an example](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38510139/) you can use. On the right-hand side, find the **"Cite"** button under the "ACTIONS" section near the top of the page.

<br><br>
A pop-up with the citation will come up. Click the **"Download .nbib"** button.

## Convert `.nbib` to `.ris`

Now we can go back to the online converter and upload the downloaded `.nbib` file. First, we need to change the format from `PMID` to `PubMed`.

<br><br>
Next to "From" use the drop down menu to find `PubMed (*.nbib format)`.
<br><br>

<br><br>
Either drag and drop the `.nbib` file or choose the file through your file explorer.
<br><br>

<br><br>
Double check that it looks like this: **From `PubMed (*.nbib format)` To `RIS`** then click the **"â†’ Convert"** button.
<br><br>

Finally, click the **"Download RIS file"** button.
<br><br>
